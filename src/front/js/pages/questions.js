        The frequency of car washes will depend on your driving style and desired level of cleanliness. Consider your driving style first. Do you commute only a short distance to work, parking your vehicle in a garage all day? Do you have a longer commute, in which case leaving your car exposed to the weather—rain, sun, dust, bird droppings—would put it at risk? You should wash your automobile more frequently depending on how frequently you drive it and the factors it encounters.

        Maintaining a clean engine bay is critical for the longevity and performance of your vehicle's engine. While immediately spraying water into the engine bay might seem like a simple fix, it can actually do a lot of harm. It's ideal to either hire a specialized detailer like <strong>StarWash </strong> to clean your engine bay or if you prefer to do it yourself, be sure to follow the instructions we provided for safe and efficient engine bay cleaning. Keep in mind that maintaining your car's engine will ensure it runs smoothly and safely for many years to come.

These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
