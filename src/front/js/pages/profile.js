                <p>Pets are the main reason people require sitters and so their welfare is my main priority and I spend much of the time in their company at your home following your instructions meticulously.

I have had numerous cats since I was young and am definitely a cat lover. Through house and pet sitting, I have had the pleasure of looking after and loving many cats, from young kittens to 22 year olds, all with different personalities and some requiring medication; as well as different breeds of dogs, from Labradors to miniature cavoodles, all whose company I thoroughly enjoyed. I also had Beau, my budgie, for quite a few years and taught him to talk! Libby, my sister, who sometimes accompanies me on sits, has had dogs for pets, from a German shepherd to a silky terrier, a cat and a budgie.</p>
