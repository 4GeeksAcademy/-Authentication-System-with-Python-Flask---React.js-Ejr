        </h3>
        <p>
          Pets are the main reason people require sitters and so their welfare
          is my main priority and I spend much of the time in their company at
          your home following your instructions meticulously. I have had
          numerous cats since I was young and am definitely a cat lover. Through
          house and pet sitting, I have had the pleasure of looking after and
          loving many cats, from young kittens to 22 year olds, all with
          different personalities and some requiring medication; as well as
          different breeds of dogs, from Labradors to miniature cavoodles, all
          whose company I thoroughly enjoyed. I also had Beau, my budgie, for
          quite a few years and taught him to talk! Libby, my sister, who
          sometimes accompanies me on sits, has had dogs for pets, from a German
          shepherd to a silky terrier, a cat and a budgie.
